# GKD-Pixel-MinUI-Addons
Add-on package to integrate GKD Pixel's standalone stock emulators into the MinUI navigation interface<br><br>

Using <a href="https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI">MinUI</a>'s pak function, we can create alternative folders for hard-to-run consoles (SNES and PS1 specifically) whose performance is better using the GKD Pixel's standalone stock emulators, and then add scripts to launch problematic games with the standalone emulator instead of the default MinUI core.
